Setup up a measurement from a config file
Save settings to config
take and save measurement to time stamped and labeled files in a determined directory
Other calculations can be added on later

Notes
=====
Use hard copy outputs?
How to do setup of several machines in a single environment?

Configuration Files
===================
Use a plain text editable file, using configparser with python3
Use another config file for the general setup and one for a specific measurement
this will allow for inheritance like behaviour

General Config
    - IP address of gpib controller
    - port

Device Config
    - gpib address
    - instrument name
    - Generic gpib configuration
    - device mode (like using interrupts)
    - Set datetime SYSTem:DATE, SYSTem:TIME
    - MMEMory:DATA will allow to and from a disk access over gpib
    - SYSTem:BEEPer:STATe will allow beep to be turned off
    - Start in default mode? SYSTem:PRESet -> store current settings for reapplying after complete?

Measurement Config
    - File name format with date time
    - directory
    - measurment type (intrrupt or poll)
    - Data format
    - Can take images using hard copy, tiff is settable with language

Instrument Setup
    - Use the config scripts and send out the data, make the sequence of commands
    transparant to the user by logging all traffic in readable ways
    - Query the installed features
    - Optional startup test of hardware
    - Calibration
